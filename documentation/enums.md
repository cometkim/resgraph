You define an enum by defining a variant without payloads and tag it with `@gql.enum`:

```rescript
@gql.enum
type userStatus = Online | Offline
```

```graphql
enum UserStatus {
  Online
  Offline
}
```

- Enums must be variants without payloads

## Using enums in the schema

Enums are valid to use anywhere in your schema where they are valid in GraphQL. ResGraph just needs to understand that it's your particular enum it's looking for. A few examples:

## Comments and deprecations

You can add comments to the enum definition, and to each enum case. You can also add deprecations to each enum case via the `@deprecated` attribute. Here's a full example demonstrating all of the above:

```rescript
/** The status of the user.*/
@gql.enum
type userStatus =
  | /** The user is online. */ Online
  | /** The user is offline. */ Offline
  | /** The user is idle. */ @deprecated("This is going away") Idle
```

```graphql
"""
The status of the user.
"""
enum UserStatus {
  """
  The user is online.
  """
  Online
  """
  The user is offline.
  """
  Offline
  """
  The user is idle.
  """
  Idle @deprecated(reason: "This is going away")
}
```

## Customizing enum case values

Sometimes you want to customize the value of an enum case for various reasons, in a way that might not be possible given ReScript's rules around naming variant cases. For that, you can use the `@as` attribute together with a string literal:

```rescript
@gql.enum
type userStatus =
  |Â @as("ONLINE") Online
  | @as("OFFLINE") Offline
```

```graphql
enum UserStatus {
  ONLINE
  OFFLINE
}
```
